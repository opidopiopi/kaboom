# Kaboom - tiling window manager for windows
You might ask yourself why 'Kaboom', that doesn't seem to have anything to do with tiling window managers?
And your right it doesn't. BUT I wasn't creative enought to come up with any other name, so here we go.

Anyhow, Kaboom is a tiling window manager for windows.
It can do stuff. What stuff can it do you ask?
Well I am working on that one, but so far: nothing.
Well, a few green tests but as far as tiliing windows goes nothing.
