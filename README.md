# Kaboom - tiling window manager for windows
You might ask yourself why 'Kaboom', that doesn't seem to have anything to do with tiling window managers?
BUT, imagine aaalll the people, that thought jeez window explorer sucks. And then Kaboom! Here is a solution!
Yeah, I know not the most creative story ever...

Anyhow, Kaboom is a tiling window manager for windows.
It tiles windows. The shortcuts suck at this point, but dont worry I'll change that asap...

If you insist on trying it now, here are the shortcuts:</br>
Move windows: Alt + (j, k, l, i) </br>
Move Selection: Alt + (w, a, s, d) </br>
Wrap Window with Vertical Arrangement: Alt + v </br>
Wrap Window with Vertical Arrangement: Alt + h </br>
Unwrap parent of selected Window: Alt + u </br>

See I told you they suck...
Some windows might not be catched and therefore not tiled.
It is really a pain in the *** to find out which window we might want to catch and which not.
I need to find a good solution for that one...

If you have any suggestions feel free to open an issue.
