# Kaboom - tiling window manager for windows
You might ask yourself why 'Kaboom', that doesn't seem to have anything to do with tiling window managers?
BUT, imagine aaalll the people, that thought jeez window explorer sucks. And then Kaboom! Here is a solution!
Yeah, I know not the most creative story ever...

Anyhow, Kaboom is a tiling window manager for windows.
It can do stuff. What stuff CAN it do, you ask?
Well I am working on that one, but so far: nothing.
Well, a few green tests but as far as tiliing windows goes nothing.
