# Kaboom - tiling window manager for windows
You might ask yourself why 'Kaboom', that doesn't seem to have anything to do with tiling window managers?
BUT, imagine aaalll the people, that thought jeez window explorer sucks. And then Kaboom! Here is a solution!
Yeah, I know not the most creative story ever...

Anyhow, Kaboom is a tiling window manager for windows.
It tiles windows. It tiles horizontally by default, a vertical arrangement is available too.

The shortcuts are no longer hardcoded. Wow amazing...
You should find the config file at %appdata%/Kaboom/settings.conf after running it once.
I used this config file parser: https://github.com/salaros/config-parser

Some windows might not be catched and therefore not tiled.
It is really a pain in the *** to find out which window we might want to catch and which not.
I need to find a good solution for that one...

If you have any suggestions feel free to open an issue.
